The seven\_seg\_6 module takes in six 4-bit binary values and converts them into the signals required to display each number (which will never exceed 9 in this design) on the FPGA's seven segment display. In this design, these inputs come directly from the parsed\_clock module that is controlled by the nes controller, and all but the most significant bit of these seven segment data lines go directly to the FPGA's seven segment display. In this design, either the most significant bit of the parsed\_clock OR the output of the vcr\_decoder are displayed on the seven segment display's most leftmost digit, depending on the state of the switch0 design input (determined by the mux2 submoduele of the vcr\_decoder module).

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } Six 4-bit binary value inputs from the parsed\_clock module that describe the one's and ten's places of the seconds, minutes, and hours of the clock. These values never exceed 59 seconds, 59 minutes, and 23 hours, so each place can only be 0-9 and failure of the sevenseg submodules due to overflow is impossible.
\item \textbf{Outputs: } Six 7-bit outputs describing how to display each input on a seven segment display. All but the most significant bit of these seven segment data lines go directly to the FPGA's seven segment display.

\subsection{ps2\_keyboard Functional Unit}
\catcode`_=8
PS/2 is an interface for keyboards and mice to PC via a 6-pin Mini-DIN connector. The system must provide the keyboard or mouse with 5V source and ground connections. Communication occurs over two wires, a clock line and a data line. The clock has a frequency between 10 kHz and 16.7 kHz. The data has a start bit, which is set as logic low, one byte of data, a parity bit, and a stop bit, which is set as logic high. Each bit is read on the falling edge of the clock signal. In the schematics, ps2\_data and ps2\_clk first synchronized and debounced. The data signal is then loaded to a shift register on falling edges of the PS/2 clock so that the flip flops can store the data. When the data transmission is finished and the clock remains high for more than 55us, the time longer than half of the worst-case PS/2 clock period, idle counter sends logic high to the AND gate. If there is no error and the signal from the idle counter is high, ps2\_code\_new becomes logic high indicating that the block is ready for the next signal. The ps2\_code[7..0] gets ps2\_word[8..1] because flip flops in that position contain the data. In the simulation, the waves indicate clock with 50MHz, ps2\_clk, ps2\_data, ps2\_code\_new, and ps2\_code[7..0] in sequence. The signals for ps2\_clk and ps2\_data are gotten from the csv file provided. After ps2\_word[10..0] stores the signal of ps2\_data at the falling edge of the ps2\_clk, ps2\_code\_new becomes 1 and ps2\_word[8..1] is sent to ps2\_code[7..0] if there is no error. The simulation figures below shows the simulation of pushing the keys of a, s, d, f, w, e, r, and t. The keys in PS/2 Keyboard have make code in hexadecimal. The code for the keys used in this project is 0x1C, 0x1B, 0x23, 0x2B, 0x1D, 0x24, 0x2D, and 0x2C respectively. The codes are shown in the simulation in the binary format.  A block diagram follows in \textbf{Figure 32}.  The logic symbol follows in \textbf{Figure 33}.  The simulation results follow in \textbf{Figure 34}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The PS/2 keyboard module has three inputs, clk, ps2\_data, ps2\_clk. The clk is the clock signal of 50MHz, ps2\_clk is the clock signal sent from the PS/2 keyboard to read the data, and the ps2\_data is the data sent from PS/2 keyboard. 
\item \textbf{Outputs: } The PS/2 keyboard module has two outputs, ps2\_code[7..0], ps2\_code\_new. The ps2\_code[7..0] is the make code data for keys on the keyboard, and ps2\_code\_new indicates whether the module is ready for the next data or not.

\subsubsection{debounce Component Block}
\catcode`_=8
When using mechanical switches, the signals often rebound, or bounce, off one another before settling into a stable state. The debounce component is used for successfully sending the data in a stable state. Two flip flops in the design check whether the data changes or not via the XOR gate. If the data changes, the counter block receives the signal to reset the counter. If not, the counter increases until it reaches the specified time and enables the output register. According to simulation, when the data remains stable for 40 ns, the data is sent to the last flip flop and the result signal is updated.  A block diagram follows in 	extbf{Figure 35}.  The simulation results follow in \textbf{Figure 36}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The debounce block has one input: button. It indicates the input from the keyboard.

The nes\_data input is the only input connected to the nes controller.
\item \textbf{Outputs: } Two outputs (nes\_latch and nes\_clock) that are sent to the nes controller and signal to the controller to start sending the first or next button states along nes\_data, respectively; ready\_to\_read, which is driven high by the module after the system has completed an input reading period and is ready for another round of reading; and eight outputs describing the most recently read states of each of the buttons on the nes controller (active low, they are the A, B, Start, Select, Up, Down, Left, and Right Buttons).

This submodule also allows for 4 modes of speed (MEGA, Super, Double, and Normal speeds). MEGA is 2048, Super is 1024, and Double is 2 times as fast as the Normal speed.

\subsubsection{parser Component Block}
\catcode`_=8
The parser submodule takes in a binary value up to 30-bits wide of slowed clock ticks, divides it by the number of clock ticks per second (9537 in this design, due to the delay block), and parses it into seconds, minutes, and hours (in decimal notation) to match the typcial clock format of (HH.MM.SS). The logic symbol follows in \textbf{Figure 51}.  The simulation results follow in \textbf{Figure 52}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The count of clock ticks of the parsed\_clock module, outputted by the counter submodule.
\item \textbf{Outputs: } The total seconds counted so far (used for resetting at 24 hours), and six 4-bit binary value outputs describing the one's and ten's places of the seconds, minutes, and hours of the parsed clock.

\subsubsection{comparator Component Block}
\catcode`_=8
The comparator submodule takes in the total seconds counted by the parsed clock since the last reset, and sends a signal to reset the system when it is greater than or equal to the number of seconds in 24 hours. This prevents the clock from outputting values over what is possible in the typical clock format (HH.MM.SS). The logic symbol follows in \textbf{Figure 53}.  The simulation results follow in \textbf{Figure 54}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The total seconds counted by the parsed clock since the last reset (default max width of 30-bits, called a).
\item \textbf{Outputs: } Whether the total seconds input (a) is greater than or equal to the number of seconds in a day ($60*60*24=3600$).

\subsection{SquareWaveGenerator Functional Unit}
\catcode`_=8
Square Wave Generator generates square wave and it is used to generate tones in the piano in this project. When ps2\_code[7..0] is read from the PS/2 Keyboard functional unit, a decoder decodes the data into three-digit binary data. The SquareWaveGenerator block receives the data and converts it into the square wave with specific Hz that indicates notes in the piano. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The square wave generator schematic has three inputs, clk\_50MHz, ps2\_code[7..0], en. The clk\_50MHz is the clock with a frequency of 50MHz, ps2\_code[7..0] is the 8-bit data sent from PS/2 keyboard, and en is the switch that allows the SquareWaveGenerator block to send a data to output signal sqWave.
\item \textbf{Outputs: } The square wave generator schematic has one output, sqWave. It shows the square wave with a specific Hz to generate the tone in the piano. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SquareWaveGenerator Component Block}
\catcode`_=8
The square wave generator block converts eight types of 3-bit data from 0b000 to 0b111 into a square wave. In the SystemVerilog file, the internal counter div\_cnt is compared to max\_count which indicates the period taken to reach specific hz. If div\_cnt reaches max\_count, tmp\_clk changes to make a square wave. The en signal determines whether the tmp\_clk is sent to speaker or not. To make it clear, max\_count for middle C is 95419 because the period for 262Hz is 3816973ns. Considering that the clock has the frequency of 50MHz, the signal is read in every 20ns and the square wave should be changed after it passes half of the period. Therefore, after calculating 3816973/20/2=95419. The max\_count for other notes is also derived from this calculation. The notes from the middle C to the C with next octave have the frequency of 262 Hz, 294 Hz, 330 Hz, 350 Hz, 392 Hz, 440 Hz, 494 Hz, and 523 Hz in sequence. This means that each note has the period of 381673 ns, 3401360 ns, 3030303 ns, 2857142 ns, 2551020 ns, 2272727 ns, 2024291 ns, and 1912045 ns respectively. When they are simulated in the period, the square wave changes only once at the half of the period as shown below. The logic symbol follows in \textbf{Figure 55}.  The simulation results follow in \textbf{Figure 56}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The SquareWaveGenerator block has four inputs, clk, note[2..0], en, and reset. The clk is the clock with a frequency of 50MHz, and note[2..0] is the decoded data from the decoder to determine the note to generate. The en and reset performs as a switch for the block.
\item \textbf{Outputs: } The SquareWaveGenerator block has one input, speaker. It shows the square wave generated from the block.

The logic symbol follows in \textbf{Figure 57}.  The simulation results follow in \textbf{Figure 58}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } The decoder block has one input, a[7..0]. It indicates the input 8-bit data, which is the make code for keys on the keyboard.

The nes\_to\_motor module converts nes button states coming from the nes\_deccoder module and converts them to the signals used internally in the L293D\_encoder module to interface with the L293D DC motor controller. This is a module completely internal to the design that converts between the output and input signal conventions of other modules. The logic symbol follows in \textbf{Figure 59}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:  } Four active-high inputs describing that a system of two motors (like a tank) should turn left (left), turn right (right), drive forward (forward), or drive backward (backward), respectively. In this design, these inputs come from the inverted left, right, up, and down button states of the nes controller.
\item \textbf{Outputs: } Whether motors 1 (left) and 2 (right) should be spinning (motor\_1\_on and motor\_2\_on); and which direction each motor should spin if also enabled, where logic high correlates to clockwise motion and low to counterclockwise (motor\_1\_dir and motor\_2\_dir for each motor, respectively).
